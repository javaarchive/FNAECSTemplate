hello. this is my personal template project for using [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA) and [MoonTools.ECS](https://gitea.moonside.games/MoonsideGames/MoonTools.ECS) in visual studio code. 

## what?

FNA is a game programming library that exists to preserve microsoft's XNA library. it's good for making simple games quickly. 

MoonTools.ECS is an entity component system library made by my friend evan. it is as far as i know the best available ECS library for C#. 

i also use [FontStashSharp](https://github.com/FontStashSharp/FontStashSharp) for text loading and rendering.

within this template you will also find copious loving explanatory comments for people new to these tools. 

## prerequisites

- [git](https://git-scm.com) (obviously)
- [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and the omnisharp extension
- [the .NET 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

## instructions

- clone this repository into a folder with the name of your project by running `git clone https://github.com/prophetgoddess/FNAECSTemplate <PROJECTNAME>`
- `cd` into that directory and run `setup.sh`. if you're on windows, i recommend using git bash for this. this should rename the project folder, solution, file, and namespace according to your project name, in addition to downloading the required dlls and installing all the required submodules from FNA. if you're on windows, you may get an error message with the phrase `InitializeSecurityContext failed`: follow the instructions in [this issue](https://github.com/prophetgoddess/FNAECSTemplate/issues/3) to resolve. 
- open the folder in visual studio code, and push `F5` to build the project. you should be greeted with the cornflower blue of success.
- you can update the dependencies by running `git submodule update --init --remote --recursive`.
