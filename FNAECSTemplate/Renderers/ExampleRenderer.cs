    this is a renderer. a renderer is just like a system,

    *never* update components from within a renderer.

    how you structure your renderers is up to you. 
    you may get value from splitting your renderers up into say,
    a HUD renderer and a world renderer. or you can go monolith-style.
    there are advantages to both ([lcd soundsystem voice] advantages! advantages!),
    but the monolith-style renderer can be more useful in a 3D context.

            they have to be in their own batch.

            it's also good practice to create a sprite atlas using a texture packer, 
            and draw all your sprites from the same Texture2D, specifying which sprite you want using
            the rectangle parameter. there are many tools out there that will spit out a packed texture
            and JSON metadata to get your rectangles from. i recommend cram: https://gitea.moonside.games/MoonsideGames/Cram

                practically, you'd probably be getting this information from a component.

                what this will do is put each of our components on a separate line of text, 
                and display the value of the example property while setting the font color
                to be white if the property is 1, black if it's 0, and various greys in between.
